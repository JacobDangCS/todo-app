# ToDo-App Phase 2
A front-end application that extends and expands on Phase 1 where the functionality of the application now allows the user to show To Do Items and determine whether they're completed.

## Project Outline
Phase 2 consists of implementing the Context API further and provide a form that accounts for To Do items as well as a settings feature that allows for certain customization. Furthermore, the project stylization is meant to mimic the Lab's screen of a "final product".
